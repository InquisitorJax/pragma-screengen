# Screengen Excersize

## Introduction
This project is set up and configured to use pragma screengen.  
The purpose of this excersize is to get familiar with the template json structure in defining screens using the template parser.

## What to develop
This excersize will be similar to what you will be doing in developing default tempaltes for pragma software.
Develop te staff template to be used as part of the dynamic resource (master/detail) screen.
This design can be found in the developer-notes folder.

## Schema
You can define any html structure in the schema, this includes custom elements and custom attributes.
Custom aurelia attributes can also be used. Most of the time you will not need to use it though.

For more information about how the schema structure is defined please read:
